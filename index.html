        <h2>Rusted and forgotten. And yet...</h2>
        <p>
            Don't rule them out. Through ingenious minds and entrepreneuring risk taking, these once architectural centers of industry and commerce are seeing a new day. Breweries, medical campuses and interesting new takes on repurposing yesterday's abandoned factories all contribute to making these old auto capitals an actual destination to the curious and young at heart.

            Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! You really think you can fly that thing? Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Checkmate... Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.

            Must go faster. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?
